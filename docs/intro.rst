Introduction
=====================

**PXC** stands for **P**\ython e\ **X**\periment **C**\ontroller.

The primary motivation behind writing this code is support for quick and flexible experiments in homebuilt cryostats.
This is accomplished through the following principles:

* Relatively simple driver-based system to support adding any instrument one can hook up to a computer

* Sequence-based measurement

* Flexible plotting interface

* Parallelized processing for all of these tasks
